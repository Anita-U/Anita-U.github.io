            <p>Who says pancakes have to be greasy and fattening? <br> At Desserlicious, we ditched traditional flour for oat flour and proved that healthy living doesn't have to be boring living *insert a winking emoji* Sweetened with Stevia we have cut out refined sugar and introduced nature's natural sweetner for your delight. Our pancakes are drizzled with organic maple syrup from the Maple land (Canada) and Fresh raspberries from the fertile lands of Plateau state, Nigeria, we guarantee you'll be coming back for more.</p>

                <p>Say yes to cupcakes; atleast to our cupcakes. <br> This one is going to leave you and your kids highlyly impressed. A mix of almond flour, cocoa and bananas is definitely a mix made in gourmet heaven. We dare you to try one today and we assure that you would be unable to differentiate between this and a bar of chocolate lodged in between the most lush cake you can imagine (but that is not the good news!). The good news is that all ingredients are 100% natural and one cupcake is less than a 100 calories. Speak of guilt-free indulgence!
